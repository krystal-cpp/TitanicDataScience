# 🧠 Titanic Survival Prediction – Data Science Project

A classic beginner-friendly project to explore data analysis and build a predictive model. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and more.

## 📌 Project Description

This is my first real Data Science project aimed at gaining hands-on experience with real-world datasets and the typical end-to-end workflow: from loading and cleaning data to visualizing patterns and building a machine learning model.

The dataset is taken from the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 Project Workflow

- 📥 Loaded and explored the dataset
- 📊 Performed data visualization and EDA
- 🧹 Handled missing values and cleaned the data
- 🔧 Converted categorical features to numeric
- 🤖 Trained a logistic regression model
- 📈 Evaluated model performance
